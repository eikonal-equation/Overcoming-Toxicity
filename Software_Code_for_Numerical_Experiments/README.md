This folders contains software source code for numerical experiments. The PDE solvers are implemented in C++ and the results are visualized in MATLAB. The software is written to be flexible and easy to modify. The software is organized into folders for different types of PDEs and numerical experiments. The folders are named after the experiments. Fig S5 was implemented in Jyputer notebook by AG.
